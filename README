# Introduction

This is a simple project developed as a hobby in my free time to test the performance of some simple web applications and to explore some good practices, such as tiny types and test-driven development. Feel free to use this code as you want. Any suggestions/comments are more than welcome!

# How to run

This is an [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) dynamic web project and should be easy to import into your workspace. It is a dynamic web project because there is a simple servlet (for performance tests).

# What is inside?

Beside the benchmark/stress-test code, there is also:

* A simple servlet (/SimpleServlet) which replies "Hello world!" (class SimpleServlet)
* A simple socket server which replies "Hello world!" through HTTP protocol (class SimpleSocketServer)
* A HTTP response inspector, that makes a request to an address and prints the full response in plain text
